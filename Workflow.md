# Workflow of my three-tire application:
---

- *Home page* is the index page, which has a grid of blogs each having a cover image, description along with published date.
- *Axios* fetches all the blogs from db and render it on home page.
- When a particular blog is clicked, *title of that blog* is send as a prop to filter the blog's content.
- Then using useNavigate hook, we navigate to *documentation page* along with *title, cover image and its content as a state*.
- Using *useLocation* hook we destruct the objects in the *documentation page*.
- In *documentation page*, it dynamically renders content of that blog with *switch-case* logic. *In-page navigation* is provided using *AnchorLink component*.
- Spaces and line breaks formatting are handled in *documentation page*.
- In *home page*, it has a *write-blog* button. Admin only have authorization to write blogs. When the *write-blog* btn is clicked, it navigates to the *Authentication Page*.
- If authenticated, then admin is take to *cover page* or else navigates to the *home page*.
- In *cover page* we can add *title*, *description* and *cover image* for our blog.
- When the *save btn* is clicked, *axios* make *post request* to django endpoints. It has a content type of 'multipart/form-data' because of the combination of *json string and image file*.
- Django *urls.py* check its endpoints and its corresponding *views* are called. It has two views that is *headerView* for handle *cover page* and *inputfieldView* for handle *content page*.
- After performing *serialization* objects are stored in db and send *status code* as a response to *axios*.
- Add media root and media urls in *settings.py* and *urls.py* to serve static images.
- After saving the *cover page*, it navigates to *content page* along with state of *blog title*.
- Here *blog title* is used as a unique identifier to filter the contents.
- *Content page* has *Add heading*, *Add Text*, *Add Code*, *Add image* buttons.
- *Content page* dynamically renders input field with the *switch-case* logic and *Fly-in* animation is applied for input fields.
- *Image preview* is available when uploading the image in the *content page*.
- *Monaco editor* is added, when we write a code.
- When the *Publish Blog* is clicked, it makes a *post request* to django endpoints. Where *image file* is set as a *base64* encoded string.
- In django, *inputfieldView* handles the *content page* request. *Decode the base64* string into image file with blog-title as a name.
- After performing *serialization*, it stores object in a db and send *status code* as a response to axios.
- Using *docker-compose*, we deploy this three-tier application as a *Containerized blog writing application*.
